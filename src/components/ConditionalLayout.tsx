 * - Complete header/footer hiding for dashboard routes
 * - Clean auth page layouts
 * - Main website layout with header/footer
 * - Responsive design across all device types
 * 
 * Route Logic:
 * - Dashboard routes (/dashboard*): No header, no footer, independent layout
 * - Auth routes (/login, /signup, etc.): No header, no footer, clean layout
 * - Main website routes: Full header and footer
 * 
 * @param children - Page content from Next.js routing
